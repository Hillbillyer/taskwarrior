# Taskwarrior Configuration Files

These are custom aliases that I use to make using Taskwarrior simpler.
This is the Official Taskwarrior website.
https://taskwarrior.org/

Run this command to pull the scripts and add the aliases to your .bashrc file.
```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hillbillyer/taskwarrior/main/setup.sh)
```
